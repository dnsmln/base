### Completely get rid of Amazon
This one speaks for itself, as much as it’s convenient, especially with younger kids. It hurts myself but moreover the whole economy and labor force when I conveniently buy cheaper goods rather than shopping locally. I’m close to completing this one.

### Make an habit of lower sugar intake
Sugar is everywhere, and has a strong impact on hormone balance and mood. This is something I’ve noticed the last 10 years and working passively to adjust.

Despite all the blood tests, experiments with glucose meter and co, the bottom line is the lower sugar intake, the better. I don’t really know how to tackle it longterm but I’m motivated to fix this.

### Stop caffeine longterm
Where would the world be without caffeine.

### Open source iOS app
I got an iOS app, sorta ready to be published. It’s a screen time app without the hefty subscription. Rather than asking for money for it (I was thinking of a $2 one-time fee), I want to “offer” it by opening the codebase. It’s nothing fancy but it works simply.
