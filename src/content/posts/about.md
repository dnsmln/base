excerpt: An obsessive organizer turned software designer. I write about what sticks to my mind—usually technology, design, and their impact on offline life.

I'm what happens when you give an obsessive organizer a computer and tell them to make things functional and easy to understand.

I design software interfaces, which is really just interior decorating for computers. I've teamed up with big and small teams to solve tricky software puzzles over the last 10+ years.

While my background is in graphic design, I’ve found my calling with designing software.

### This place...
I tend this website like a digital garden. Where I write about what I care most about, living with intention and how technology plays into that.

### Buddhism
Mid-2024, my partner introduced me to Buddhism and a couple of classes from [Ethan Nichtern](http://ethannichtern.com), a Buddhist teacher and author, I recommend his work. It was approachable, and practical. It opened myself to questions about my relationship with design and my own identity. This eventually led to very positive change, taking some professional risks for the best.

### Bouldering
I’m an injured athlete. My body is aching from years of playing rugby, not stretching.

Couple years ago, I took a bad snowboard fall that led to a shoulder dislocation. The hazard made it that I met an incredible trainer which is now one of my best friend, someone I highly trust with my health.

For the last few years, we’ve worked together to reinforce my shoulder control and this led to eventually getting into bouldering. 

I'm aiming to climb **v6/v7** routes by end of the climbing season where I reside, early winter in Quebec. It’d be challenging, yet achievable with the right order of training.

### Trail running
I’ve never liked running on roads. I love heading out early in the morning to the mountain that's just 5 minutes from my home - it feels like my personal garden.

I've found my sweet spot with 25km trail runs, which provide just the right challenge without consuming too much of my day.
