excerpt: An obsessive organizer turned software designer. I write about what sticks to my mind—usually technology, design, and their impact on offline life.

I'm what happens when you give an obsessive organizer a computer and tell them to make things functional and easy to understand.

### Software
I design software interfaces, which is really just interior decorating for computers. I've teamed up with big and small teams to solve tricky software puzzles over the last 10+ years.

While my background is in graphic design, I’ve found my calling with designing software.

### Digital garden
I tend this website like a digital garden. Where I write about what I care most about, living with intention and how technology plays into that.
