I've published a tiny site presenting the Beta version [Zooom](https://zooooooom.com). It's simple, but playfull, just like Zooom is so far.

## Public Beta

The beta is now open to public, I got couple of strangers (who knows how they found the link) and friends/family members testing the app. [Try it for yourself](https://testflight.apple.com/join/MD83ER1W)

You can zoom in two directions, from both front and back cameras, with 4/5 loops. I'm adding more loops and features slowly.

## Backlog

This is my to-do list at the time of writing. I'm struggling to add the halo showed on the video preview in the export (and ideally as an export option). The next most important item is the onboarding, I'm not super excited to work on this, I don't know why but I have to do it sooner than later.
