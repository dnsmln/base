For the last few weeks, I've been trying different apps that would turn my phone into something closer to the minimalist Light Phone.

I tried a few: Blank, Dumb Phone, and Smile App Launcher—the latter being the one I stuck with the most. Yet, despite their best efforts, launching an app wasn't the smoothest experience.

So I went back to a more integrated and simple solution using the Shortcuts app and custom icons.

I only kept my most important apps: Camera, Homecam, Safari and Messages (Clockwise)

I also kept the minimal and uniform initial design, but to differentiate each app, I chose shapes that I associate with each one.

It's been a week since I made the change, and I'm still happy with it. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out—I'd be happy to help.
