[Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/topic-blockers) recently proposed the concept of hiding specific topics.

A similar idea would let users define personal keywords to blur on the browser level. I would, totally randomly, choose to blur terms like `AI`, `Trump`, `Growth`, you get the idea.

Rather than completely removing content, the browser extension would apply a CSS blur filter to the parent block containing specified keywords, making them less visually intrusive.
