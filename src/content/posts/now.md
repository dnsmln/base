excerpt: What I'm currently working on and thinking about.

### Buddhism
Mid-2024, my partner introduced me to Buddhism and a couple of classes from [Ethan Nichtern](http://ethannichtern.com), a Buddhist teacher and author, I recommend his work. It was approachable, and practical. It opened myself to questions about my relationship with design and my own identity. This eventually led to very positive change, taking some professional risks for the best.

### Bouldering
I’m an injured athlete. My body is aching from years of playing rugby, not stretching.

Couple years ago, I took a bad snowboard fall that led to a shoulder dislocation. The hazard made it that I met an incredible trainer which is now one of my best friend, someone I highly trust with my health.

For the last few years, we’ve worked together to reinforce my shoulder control and this led to eventually getting into bouldering. 

I'm aiming to climb **v6/v7** routes by end of the climbing season where I reside, early winter in Quebec. It’d be challenging, yet achievable with the right order of training.

### Trail running
I’ve never liked running on roads. I love heading out early in the morning to the mountain that's just 5 minutes from my home - it feels like my personal garden.

I've found my sweet spot with 25km trail runs, which provide just the right challenge without consuming too much of my day.
