In 2017, the New York-based studio [This Also](http://thisalso.com) released an iOS app called [OOO](https://www.producthunt.com/products/ooo).

**OOO** let you zoom or un-zoom while recording a video and overlay it with looped music. It had 5 to 6 different "themes" and was super simple to use. Press and move up or down on your screen to record and control the zoom; release to stop and save the video.

Two examples — the sound is ON:

<video src="/images/journal/ooo-1781406D-7ACA-4669-8453-D325789975B0.mov" controls playsinline style="border-radius: var(--radius);"></video>

<video src="/images/journal/ooo-BC2D38AC-7508-414E-BF74-215DE8E53662.mov" controls playsinline style="border-radius: var(--radius);"></video>

## Why revive it

The first and main reason is selfish: I want to use the app. I've been wanting to use it periodically since it was taken off the App Store.

Another reason is that music filters as good as Zooom's now exist solely on social media apps. Unless you're recording and publishing through those apps, you don't get the fun filter.

## Minimal start

Start with one music track — likely the same "Sad Saxo" from the examples above — one zoom direction, all while recording a video.

The video should be stored in the user's photo library, ideally under a separate folder. The interface can be minimal, but we'd need permissions to record and save videos.

## If you're interested...

I'm going to start building the first version in the next few weeks. I'm not even sure I'll end up publishing it, and if I do, it'll probably be free or cost less than $2.
